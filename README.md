## üê≥ Docker

### Multi-architecture Support

This project's Docker images are built for multiple architectures:

- x86/AMD64
- ARM64

This ensures compatibility with various deployment environments, including:

- Standard cloud environments
- Raspberry Pi and other ARM-based devices
- Apple Silicon Macs

### Building Custom Docker Images

```bash
# Build for current architecture
docker build -t qsys-qrc-tool .

# Build for multiple architectures
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t qsys-qrc-tool --push .
```

## üîÑ CI/CD

Continuous Integration and Deployment is managed through GitHub Actions:

- Each push to the main branch automatically:
  - Builds the library and application
  - Publishes the Docker image to Docker Hub
  - Tags the image based on version and with 'latest'
  - Deploys the app to GitHub Pages

### Demo Version

A live demo of the latest version is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages with each push to the main branch:

## üîå Connecting to Q-SYS Core Devices

### Handling Self-Signed Certificates

Q-SYS Core devices use self-signed SSL certificates for secure communications. When connecting to a Core for the first time, your browser will display a security warning. This is normal and expected.

### Steps to Accept the Certificate

Before you can use the QRC Tool with your Q-SYS Core:

1. Open your browser and navigate directly to your Core's IP address (e.g., `https://192.168.1.100`)
2. You'll see a warning similar to the one below:

![Certificate Warning](docs/images/certificate-warning.jpg)

3. Depending on your browser:

   - **Chrome**: Click "Advanced" and then "Proceed to [IP] (unsafe)"
   - **Firefox**: Click "Advanced", then "Accept the Risk and Continue"
   - **Safari**: Click "Show Details" and then "visit this website"
   - **Edge**: Click "More information" and then "Go on to the webpage"

4. Once you've accepted the certificate for your Core's IP address, return to the QRC Tool and proceed with your connection.

### Security Note

While accepting a self-signed certificate creates an exception in your browser, it's only valid for:

- The specific Core IP address you visited
- Your current browser

If you connect to a different Core or use a different browser/device, you'll need to repeat this process.

### Using QRC Tool with Multiple Cores

If you work with multiple Q-SYS Cores:

1. Create a bookmarks folder in your browser for your Cores
2. Visit each Core's IP directly and accept the certificate
3. After accepting all certificates, you can use the QRC Tool seamlessly with all your Cores

### Enterprise Environments

For enterprise environments with many Cores, consider:

- Setting up a proper Certificate Authority (CA)
- Installing trusted certificates on your Cores
- Consult the Q-SYS documentation on "Enterprise Certificate Management"
